3.Prompt task:
 
 You must type : prompt = something , prompt= something , or prompt =something wont work , amount of spaces between the strings doesn't matter.
 
 4.echo $? task:
 
 Prints 0 on success , 1 on failure.
 
 6.Last command task : !!
 
 If the last command was !! , and you type !! again it will print an error that the command !! doesn't exist.
 
10.Adding variables task:
 
 If you add the variable $person = David , and then you type again : $person = Tal , it will interptate the string : $David = Tal , so it will print and error , 
 since there is no commmand $tal.
